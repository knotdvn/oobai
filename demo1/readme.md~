demo0
========================

This is the first working demo.

Oobs are born with attributes of random value, they have access to a random number of 3 rules.

The clock begins to tick and oobs live and die depending on how well their rules provide for them.


Oobs who are more efficent, rule 2 vs rule 1 + 2 seem to survive longer.
